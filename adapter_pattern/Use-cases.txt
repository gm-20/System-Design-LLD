*It's a structural design pattern =>  Used to organise Classes/Interface/Objects.

*Its used so that two unrelated interfaces/Classes can work together with the help of a Adapter class.

*Dig : https://app.diagrams.net/#G1giI3gQzfvyAkC1PeODbrHCKYCyYPhY5K

*The class/interface who WANTS functionality from some other class/interface gets implemented by AdapterClass.

*And in Adapter class we define object whose methods will be used by demanding(which wants functionality form
other class) class/interface.

*Examples:
1.java.util.Arrays#asList()
2.java.io.InputStreamReader(InputStream) (returns a Reader)
3.java.io.OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream) (returns a Writer)
