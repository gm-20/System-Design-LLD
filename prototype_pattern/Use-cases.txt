*This is type of Creational Design => Used for new Object Creation,from alraedy existing Object.

*The object that needs to be cloned should have:
1.Implements Cloneable
2.Override clone() --> Can be Deep copying or Shallow copying

*Shallow Copy
This is a result of the default cloning functionality provided by the Object.clone() method if the class
has non-primitive data type members as well.
In the case of Shallow Copy, the cloned object also refers to the same object to which the original object
refers as only the object references get copied and not the referred objects.

*Deep Copy
We need to override the clone() method for the classes having non-primitive type members to achieve Deep Copy
as it requires the member objects to be cloned as well, which is not done by the default cloning mechanism.


*Use-cases:
1.It is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time 
and resources and you have a similar object already existing.
2.Provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs.
3.For ex: If i already have an Object which contains data fetched from database,
Now I need to modify data , but again fetching it from database is expensive,
So will copy original Obj to new Obj.
