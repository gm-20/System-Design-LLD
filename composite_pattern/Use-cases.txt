*It's a structural design pattern =>  Used to organise Classes/Interface/Objects.

*When we need to apply some common functionality to multiple Objects , we use Composite Design Pattern.

*It consist of 3 Components:
1.Base component (Interface)                      ----> Common funtionality
2.Leaf component (Class implement Base component) ----> Classes that need to implement common functionality
3.Composite (Class implement Base component)      ----> Logic to implement common functionality to Classes. 


*Use case:
1.Salary increment in a Organisation.
